### Connect Button / Metamask Components 
11.5.2021 --  Items were included in the Components folder : wallet/connectors.js, ConnectButton.js, MetaMaskProvider.js

Uses web3-react, web3-react/core libraries. 

Note: this connection method is different than the smart contract connection methods in ethereum/web3.js, because the button is MetaMask-specific.

Issue: the button can't auto-reset the Router on load to display the address. 


### React Components

11.5.2021 -- added Components folder / placeholder files for navigation and layout.
